# Digital Clock with 7-Segment Display Using React

This project is a digital clock widget built using React, styled to resemble a classic 7-segment display. Each number is displayed using 7 segments, where the segments light up based on the number's pattern. The design includes arrow-shaped ends for the segments, giving a unique visual style to the clock.

## Features

- Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Each number is represented by a 7-segment display.
- Segments have arrow-shaped ends for a distinctive appearance.
- Fully responsive design that updates every second.
- Dark background with white numbers for clear visibility.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The UI is built using React.
- **CSS**: The design and layout of the segments are controlled through custom CSS, including advanced techniques such as `clip-path`.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the clock updates and time formatting.

## Project Setup

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-clock-7-segment.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd digital-clock-7-segment
   \`\`\`

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

### Running the Project
